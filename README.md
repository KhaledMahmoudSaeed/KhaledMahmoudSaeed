### Hallo Welt ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m student in electric engineering department in faculty of engineering in Zagazig university. I strive to be a programming geek.
The most proverb that I love it is  " Das ist noch kein meister vom heimal gefallen" ,these proverb is in German
I learned German language and I am very good with it whether speak , write and listen .

Although, technically Iâ€™m beginning of the road through to begin my career journey,but I hope reach to mid-way by the end of this year. 

Iâ€™m currently self-developing and looking for opportunities to implement, learn and improve.
